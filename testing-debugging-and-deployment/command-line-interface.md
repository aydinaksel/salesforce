# Learn About the Command-Line Interface

## Shell

The command-line window isn't just a plain command-line interface where you enter text. Behind the window is a command-line interpreter, or shell, processing the commands you run.

PowerShell for Windows and ZSH for macOS and Linux.

# Explore Command Structure and Navigation

## Command Structure

All commands have three parts. Let's go through each of these parts, and then run some commands.

Command example:

`$ command -flag arguments`

Here is an example of a Salesforce command to create a new Salesforce DX project that contains a flag and an argument.  
  
`sf project generate -n MyProject`

- The command is: `sf project generate`
- The flag (sometimes called options) `-n` is required and tells the system what to name your new project.
- The argument is `MyProject` which is the name we are assigning to the project.
